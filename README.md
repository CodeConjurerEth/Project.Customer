This is a Game made for Saxion's Project Customer
I've worked together with a fellow engineer,2 artists, 2 designers, I was responsible for the UI, Menus and leaderboard (witch sadly doesn't work for WebGL)
You can play the game on WebGL here hosted by my fellow engineer teammate: https://teodorvecerdi.github.io/saxion_project_customer/
